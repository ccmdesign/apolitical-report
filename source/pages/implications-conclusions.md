These predictions vary in their confidence. For example, the ever- escalating arms race between activists and social media platforms is a virtual certainty, whereas the impact of AR glasses is far less certain because of their developmental immaturity. Furthermore, while these scenarios are not mutually exclusive, the extent to which some of them materialize may reduce the odds others might do the same. For instance, the growth of free-to-use plans restricted to certain platforms may constrain the space for the multiplication of tech savvy organizations that promote activism, such as Avaaz and Nossas.

It should also be noted that none of these scenarios will emerge unintentionally. Technology is not fate, and the translation of any of the predictions into reality requires a substantive degree of human agency. The degree to which the realization of these scenarios further societal goals equally depends on which measures are taken in the near feature. In this case, despite the uncertainty inherent to this exercise, there are measures that would be prudent for governments [^21] to take.
