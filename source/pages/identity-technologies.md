Why will this technology trend likely have an impact on citizen engagement?

First, widespread adoption of identity technologies will lead many governments to require them as part of the voting process. In regimes with widespread voter fraud, this result could be a net good. However, it is well known that identity requirements are frequently used as a deliberate mechanism to exclude voters likely to support what the electoral authorities consider to the “wrong” party. Whether used for good or bad, identity technologies will affect the status quo of elections.

Second, greater usability means easier engagement. Highly usable, ubiquitous identity technologies mean that feedback, petitioning, and voting mechanisms that sit at the heart of citizen engagement can all be made quicker and easier for participants by the use of seamless digital identity mechanisms. Signing an online petition or joining a group can become one click, not several. If someone attends a local meeting and wants to express concerns, a fingerprint or a swipe of a phone screen will be able to produce a quick and authoritative record of attendee opinions. This increasing amount of data, even if not representative, is likely to influence some decisions in a way that a traditional meeting might not.

Third, these new identity systems could be used to make it clearer to decision makers that a citizen who is lobbying for or requesting some change is indeed a bona fide local citizen, not a bot or someone from another country. Citizens and activists know that decision makers are increasingly skeptical about whether speech online is actually coming from real local people. The new wave of identity technologies will make it easier for decision makers to believe the voices speaking are both human and relevant (i.e., people living in a certain area). If identity technologies are combined with social credit scoring, decision makers may feel new and acute forms of pressure to comply, as they will be exposed in detail to the size and heft mobilized by campaigns.

Society is entering an era in which decision makers will steadily obtain more precise and convincing data about who is asking them for action, which is likely to increase the pressure on decision makers to conform, especially if data are mixed with wider reputation data. However, research undertaken for this paper leads to the conclusion that confusion on the part of decision makers about whether they are being pressed for change by real residents or ‘fake’ people is likely to be a temporary phase that is likely to be largely gone within a decade.

Verifying the identity of individual citizens is only one piece of the puzzle that needs solving if politicians and decision makers are to have certainty that citizen demands are real. The next section looks at what happens if the demands are felt to be phony.
