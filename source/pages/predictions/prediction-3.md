The modern world presents citizens with an ever-increasing number of situations in which they are required to prove who they are to institutions and authority figures. From claiming food rations in refugee camps [^8] to boarding aircraft in megacity airports, the very structure of modernity appears to be premised on the idea that most people can provide some evidence about who they are, on a regular basis.

This is not entirely new. Many countries have been issuing identity cards, passports or driving licenses for decades, in some cases for centuries.[^9] However, the last two decades have seen an explosion in the number of technologies deployed to verify that a person is who they claim to be.

Passports now routinely contain a microchip allowing automated facial recognition at immigration checks and reducing interactions with border guards. Governments increasingly care more about biometric identity databases of fingerprints, irises, and faces, and less about a plastic or paper pocket card. Cards and papers can be lost, stolen, or forgotten. Irises and fingerprints are somewhat more firmly attached to their owners.

However, governments aren’t the only ones rolling out progressively sophisticated and widespread identity technologies. Credit card companies and credit rating agencies have offered identity verification for some time, especially at major life moments like buying a house or car.

More recently and more visibly, major social networks offer seemingly throwaway digital identities that over time are proving to be increasingly strong. While services like Twitter and Facebook are well known for containing large numbers of fake or duplicate accounts, this problem can sometimes conceal the remarkable robustness of mature social network user accounts as identity mechanisms. Specifically, if a person has a Facebook profile with hundreds of friends and a lively, extended, highly personal posting history, then that person controls a form of identity verification technology that is probably similarly robust to most nations’ driving license registers. In the case of social network identities, certainty is based on networks of friends and family, rather than the official stamp of an administrator.

Furthermore, the identities offered by private digital identity providers are fundamentally more flexible and interoperable than those offered by most governments. A Google profile can be used to login to thousands of apps. In most countries, a passport cannot be used to login to anything.

The overall effect of this expansion and multiplication of identity technologies is that more and more people are acquiring the ability to prove who they are, quickly, easily, and in many instances, independent of governments. And, more people are acquiring the ability to prove who they are remotely — over the internet. This development has real consequences for restricting or enhancing citizen engagement.

[^8]: The Building Blocks project is one of the first users of blockchain technology in the humanitarian field through which the World Food Programme has been distributing cash-for-food aid to Syrian refugees in Jordan.

[^9]: Early modes of identification were conceived as a travel document to provide individuals with safe passage through foreign territories. The first historical account of its use dates to around 450 BC, when King Artaxerxes of Persia allowed his royal cupbearer, Nehemiah, to travel to Jerusalem to rebuild its walls, granting him a letter requesting safe passage through lands beyond Artaxerxes ruling. King Henry V of England is credited with introducing into law a version of the passport under the Safe Conducts Act 1414. The French workers’ identity card (*livret d’ouvrier*) — streamlined by Napoleon in the early 1800s — is considered the precursor of modern national identification cards. A compulsory document to be possessed by French workers, it was a mechanism to constrain job mobility and the employment of seasonal workers who were perceived as a group prone to disorderly behavior.
