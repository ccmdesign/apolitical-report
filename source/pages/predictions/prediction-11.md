Most citizen engagement processes, from participatory budgets to general elections, depend on reliable recordkeeping. If the votes in an election are not recorded correctly, that election will generally be thought to be illegitimate. If written feedback from citizens is doctored so that criticism is recorded as praise, trust between citizens and governments will never rise.

Unfortunately, fears about this kind of abusive misreporting of data are real and widespread.

Consider, for example, the idea of online voting — the idea that citizens should be able to vote from their own devices over the internet. Despite being debated in many countries for at least two decades, electoral voting online has thus far only been rolled out in a small number of jurisdictions. This low level of global adoption is due primarily to strong and persistent concerns that the data about votes will be manipulated by malicious actors, and elections will be stolen. This is just one particularly high profile example of how a fear of unreliable digital recordkeeping has had major impacts on the level of ease for citizen engagement. While a steadily increasing proportion of global citizens access a huge array of goods and services through phones and computers, voters largely must physically visit polling stations or post paper ballots.

Elections aren’t the only area in which a lack of trust in digital recordkeeping has real impacts. Professor Marco Deseriis of Northeastern University shared the impact that unreliable data storage has on modern European political parties. Some of these parties, especially newer ones, use online platforms to allow their supporters to discuss and propose policies as well as discuss and vote on prospective candidates who might stand for election. Deseriis said that accusations about the malicious manipulation of data within these systems were now widespread. Similar stories seem likely to suppress the willingness of more citizens to get involved in these kinds of services. They will have reason to doubt that their ideas and wishes will be faithfully conveyed to their peers and to party decision makers.

Finally, doubts about robust recordkeeping have a negative impact on the effectiveness of petitions and their close cousins, citizen initiatives. Research for this paper uncovered evidence that unreliable recordkeeping of signatures on petitions has a long and problematic history.[^18] Time after time, doubts about the veracity of petition signatures have been used by politicians to delegitimize demands from citizens and resist calls for action and change.

In summary, a lack of faith in the reliability of civic recordkeeping is an active suppressor of many kinds of citizen engagement activities, both old and new.

[^18]: As early as 1916, an article in the American Political Science Review ardently criticizes how “unfair and impossible formalities” to verify the authenticity of signatures constrained participation and restricted the full use of petitions as a democratic instrument (Schnader 1916).
