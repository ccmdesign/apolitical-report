The very nature of emerging technologies is track records too short and distribution too narrow to allow for meaningful statistical or economic modeling (unlike, for example, trade data). As a consequence, the authors use an inductive and aspirational approach. Being inductive, this work does not test hypotheses after the fact. Instead the authors’ insights — and those of interviewees — are meant to be no more than general propositions based on available observations of how technologies affect, or fail to affect, citizen engagement in both distant and recent history.

This study is aspirational because it summarizes a search for ways in which emerging technologies might plausibly promote more effective citizen engagement. It also conveys concerns about the negative effects modern digital technologies can have on the governance of nations.[^3]

Despite many new challenges created, new and better citizen engagement approaches might be possible. Focusing solely on threats would add little new to a public discourse already saturated with worries. What is missing from public discourse is a wide range of options that citizens or decision makers could call on to make their interactions more successful.

To help the authors with this effort, leading researchers and practitioners in the field kindly offered interviews and comments. Where appropriate, they are quoted directly: Ben Berkowitz (SeeClickFix); Emiliana de Blasio (Center for Media and Democratic Innovations); Marco Deseriis (Northeastern University); Jonathan Fox (Accountability Research Center at American University); Erhardt Graeff (MIT Center for Civic Media); Craig Hammer, Zahid Hasnain, and Kaushal Jhalla (World Bank); Justin Herman (U.S. General Services Administration); Cesar Hidalgo (MIT Media Lab); Alexander Howard (writer and open government advocate); Luke Jordan (Grassroot); Ronaldo Lemos (Institute for Technology and Society — ITS Rio); Flavia Marzano (Rome Municipality); Rafael Morado (Dapper Labs); Leonardo Moreno (AES Corporation); Alessandra Orofino (Nossas); Tapan Parikh (Cornell Tech); Ben Rattray (Change. org); David Robinson (Upturn); Hollie Russon-Gilman (Columbia University); Antonio Saraiva (Gojira.tv); David Sasaki (Hewlett Foundation); Beth Simone Noveck and Gianluca Sgueo (New York University); Michele Sorice (LUISS); Christopher Wilson (Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation); Harry Wilson (Social Coin); and Anthony Zacharzewski (The Democratic Society).

[^3]: The authors are cognizant of the potential exclusionary effects of digitally enabled citizen engagement, particularly in developing contexts. However, this issue falls outside the scope of this study and is extensively addressed in other World Bank publications (e.g., Peixoto and Fox 2016; Spada et al. 2016; Mellon, Peixoto, and Sjoberg 2017; Mellon et al. 2017; Peixoto and Sifry 2017). The authors also recognize that their efforts are not immune to Amara’s law, where predictions about the effects of digital technologies are overestimated in the short run and underestimated in the long run.
