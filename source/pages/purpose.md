The recent rapid evolution of digital technologies has been changing behaviors and expectations in countries around the world. These shifts make it the right time to pose the key question this paper explores:

> Will digital technologies, both those that are already widespread and those that are still emerging, have substantial impacts on the way citizens engage and the ways through which power is sought, used, or contested?

There are three specific reasons why this question was chosen.

First, the World Bank works in a network of other national, local, and transnational organizations many of which work on and think about citizen engagement on an ongoing basis. This is a contribution to the ongoing debate that exists within that network.

Second, the World Bank already researches and endorses certain approaches to citizen engagement. This advice may have to change if technologically driven developments change norms and practices. 

Finally, the World Bank makes risk assessments as part of all its work, and these risk assessments may have to change if the way citizens and states interact change.

This paper explores what technology might mean for citizen engagement, whether for good or for bad. It makes a range of predictions and offers measures for governments to consider. It is one in a series of four notes from the Governance Global Practice on citizen engagement in the areas of fragility, conflict, and violence situations; governance; trust; and emerging technology.

Unlike other papers in the series, this work goes beyond the World Bank’s standard definition of citizen engagement, which is “the two-way interaction between citizens and governments or the private sector within the scope of the World Bank Group’s interventions” (World Bank 2014). A broader definition encompasses a range of activities widely understood in the literature as political and public participation, which includes both electoral and nonelectoral types of participation. This approach is aligned with recent World Bank research that highlights the interplay between electoral and nonelectoral types of participation and their role in promoting accountability and development outcomes (World Bank 2016a,b, 2017).

For clarity, the authors focus primarily on the interaction between citizens and state actors, and they do not consider interaction between citizens and other powerful actors, such as businesses.
